# Kebabine using Python Flask

## Introduction
Welcome to my **Kebabine** project! 
This repository is a demonstration of a web application developed using Python and Flask. As I am student learning Python and Flask, this project is designed to help you understand the basics of web development with Python and Flask technologies. 
The application simulates a simple kebab shop where users can browse the menu, place orders, etc.
